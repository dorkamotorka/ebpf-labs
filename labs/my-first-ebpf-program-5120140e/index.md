title: From Zero to Your First eBPF Program

description: |
  In this first tutorial, youâ€™ll run a pre-coded eBPF program and see it in action without writing any code yourself. Weâ€™ll walk through the important parts of the program so you understand how eBPF hooks and runs in the kernel. The goal is to get familiar with the workflow and core concepts before you start writing your own eBPF programs.

When you start the tutorial, youâ€™ll see a `Term 1` terminal and an `IDE` on the right-hand side. You are logged in as `laborant`, and the current working directory already contains the `ebpf-hello-world` folder. Inside, youâ€™ll find the [eBPF Hello World labs](https://github.com/dorkamotorka/ebpf-hello-world), implemented with [ebpf-go](https://ebpf-go.dev/) â€” a Golang eBPF framework developed as part of the [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) project.

And there are several good reasons for this choice:

- **Cloud Native alignment** â€“ Most Cloud Native tools are written in Go - Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, ArgoCD and so on. Learning eBPF through a Golang framework puts you one step ahead if you plan to integrate eBPF with container runtimes, or cloud tooling.

- **Proven and well-supported** â€“ ebpf-go is maintained by Cilium and supported by many large enterprises including Cisco, Google, Datadog, Cloudflare. Cilium is a leading project in the eBPF ecosystem, and its backing ensures the framework remains stable, secure, and production-ready.

- **Developer experience** â€“ The API is idiomatic Go, making it easier for Go developers to quickly become productive without context switching between languages.

- **Ecosystem integration** â€“ ebpf-go is widely adopted across observability, security, and networking projects. Skills you build here will directly transfer to real-world tools you may already be using.

- **Community and documentation** â€“ The project has active contributors, solid documentation, and plenty of real-world examples, which makes the learning curve much smoother.

If this still hasnâ€™t convinced you, check out our [blog post](https://ebpfchirp.substack.com/p/go-c-rust-and-more-picking-the-right) where we compare different frameworks and break down their pros and cons.

## The Two Sides of an eBPF Application

If you open the `ebpf-hello-world/lab1` folderâ€”using either the `Term 1` terminal or the `IDE`â€”youâ€™ll find a minimal (arguably the smallest) eBPF application we could put together.

Every eBPF application typically has two parts:

- **User-space program**: Loads the kernel-space program and attaches it to the desired tracepoint or probe in the kernel. (Here: `main.go`)
- **Kernel-space program**: Runs inside the kernel once the tracepoint/probe is hit. This is where the actual eBPF kernel logic lives. (Here: `hello.c`)

We have intentionally added code comments to (almost) every code line, just for the sake of this tutorial. Start by looking into `hello.c` and follow along with the `main.go`.

::details-box

:summary: What about vmlinux.h file?
---

At a high level, your eBPF program needs access to kernel context and data structures to do anything meaningful. For example, we could extend this tutorial's code and read the arguments passed to the `execve` system call. These arguments are available through the `trace_event_raw_sys_enter` struct â€” and that struct is defined in `vmlinux.h`.

It was generated using [bpftool](https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool) - a super handy eBPF CLI tool that weâ€™ll cover in more detail in an upcoming tutorial:
```bash
bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h
```
::

## Generating and Building the eBPF Application

Let's build the eBPF application, using:

```bash
cd ebpf-hello-world/lab1 # Go inside the ebpf-hello-world/lab1 folder if you haven't already
go generate
go build
```

Well, this is interesting â€” whatâ€™s the difference between `go build` and `go generate`, or even what are they in the first place?

`go build` is the standard command that compiles your Go code into a binary (an executable). On the other hand, `go generate` is a bit less common.

By definition, `go generate` runs code generation commands that you define in special `//go:generate` comments within your Go source files. If you look inside the `main.go`, youâ€™ll find one of these directives right at the top.

```go [main.go]{3}
package main

//go:generate go run github.com/cilium/ebpf/cmd/bpf2go -target bpf hello hello.c

import (
	"log"
	"os"
...
```

Namely, the `go generate` command will invoke a handy tool called [bpf2go](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf/tree/main/cmd/bpf2go) with some arguments passed to it. But what's really interesting, if you look inside the code of this tool is that it is nothing more that just a wrapper around `clang` - compiler for C, C++, and related languages, built as part of the LLVM project, which happens to also be used for compiling eBPF kernel code.

::details-box

:summary: What does the `-target bpf` argument do?
---

By default, eBPF applications follow the endianness of the CPU theyâ€™re compiled on.

In other words:
- If you're compiling on a little-endian CPU, the program's byte order will be little-endian.
- On a big-endian CPU, the program's byte order will be big-endian.

But interestingly enough, Clang compiler (used for eBPF programs) supports options like `amd64` or `arm64` targets for cross-compilation, enabling you to compile on one architecture and run on another.

That said, you have a couple of options for setting the -target flag when compiling the program using clang:

- `bpf`: Uses the endianness of the CPU it compiles on
- `bpfel`: Compiles for little-endian systems (x86, ARM, RISC-V, ..)
- `bpfeb`: Compiles for big-endian systems (IBM System/360, 370, 390, Z, ..)
- *architecture specific: Be it either `amd64`, `arm64` and so on

Though architecture specific compilation might rarely be a concern, it becomes important for cases like eBPF kprobes. Kprobes rely on the kernel's `struct pt_regs` input context, which stores a copy of the CPU registers' contents.

Since registers are architecture-specific, the pt_regs structure definition depends on the architecture youâ€™re running on, requiring you to specify the appropriate `-target <value>` flag.

Weâ€™ll see such an example in a future tutorial for sure.

In more simple terms, `go generate` compiles the eBPF kernel program (`hello.c`) into an object file (`hello_bpf.o`) and generates a Go source file (`hello_bpf.go`) that embeds the object and provides helper functions to work with it.

Lastly, `go build` picks up the `main.go` and `hello_bpf.go` and builds the final eBPF application binary `lab1`.

::details-box
---
:summary: What about `//go:build ignore` at the top of hello.c file?
---

Since Go files and C files are in the same folder, the Go toolchain tries to treat everything in that folder as part of the build. But files like `hello.c` are not Go files, and by default `go build` will complain if it encounters them.

```c [hello.c]{1}
//go:build ignore
#include "vmlinux.h"
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>

char _license[] SEC("license") = "GPL";

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_execve")
int handle_execve_tp(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter *ctx) {
...
```
::

## Running the eBPF Application

Now, to actually run the compiled `lab1` binary and eBPF applications in general, the `CAP_BPF` [Linux capability](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) is required. 

That's mandatory because the logic almost always uses privileged BPF operations like loading the eBPF code into the kernel, creating eBPF maps, loading BTF information, iterating over programs and maps, etc.

::remark-box

kind: info

ðŸ’¡ `CAP_BPF` is available since Linux kernel 5.8 and was introduced to separate out BPF functionality from the overloaded `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.
::

However, since in this demo environment and you can log in as `root`, this is not a problem - you've got all the permissions. 

So we can just run our eBPF application, using:

```bash
sudo ./lab1
```

The `lab1` eBPF application should now capture and log `Hello world` each time a process is executed on the system.  

Well, not exactly...

To keep this tutorial as simple as possible, our user and kernel programs arenâ€™t communicating with each other yet â€” they would need a buffer to exchange data. Weâ€™ll cover that in a future tutorial. But if youâ€™re curious, this is typically implemented using [different types of BPF maps](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/maps.html).  

For now, every time a process runs on the system, our eBPF program does capture the event and executes, but just logs the `Hello world` to the eBPF logs. This done by the following line:  

```c [hello.c]{4}
...
SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_execve")
int handle_execve_tp(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter *ctx) {
    bpf_printk("Hello world");
    return 0;
}
```

To view these logs, on the right side at the top, open the second `Term 2` tab by clicking (`+`), and run:
```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
```

It's quite unlikely you won't see any `Hello world` logs. But this could be the case, since there is little going on in a small VM like ours, so let's execute some process ourself.

Open the third `Term 3` tab, and execute:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
# or
uname -a
```

Switch back to the second `Term 2` tab and see the output.

Congrats, you've came to the end of this tutorial. ðŸ¥³
