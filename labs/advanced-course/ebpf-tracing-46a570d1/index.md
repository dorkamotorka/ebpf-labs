It is safe to say that almost all eBPF programs can extract and send kernel event data to user space applications. 

However, eBPF tracing program types like kprobes, fprobes, and tracepoints are often preferred because they hook onto points or functions in kernel with access to rich, actionable data for tasks like performance monitoring or syscall argument tracing. 

But their overlapping functionality can make choosing the right one confusing.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll implement several eBPF tracing programs that capture `execve` syscall events and compare their strengths and trade-offs.

TODO: image

## eBPF Tracepoint

Tracepoints are predefined hook points in the Linux kernel, and eBPF programs can be attached to these tracepoints to execute custom logic whenever the kernel reaches those points.

For example, the `sys_enter_execve` tracepoint captures the entry of the execve system call, providing information about the program being executed and its arguments, making it a valuable in things like auditing security events, or analyzing Linux user activity.

In the kernel this tracepoint is defined in [`linux/include/trace/events/syscalls.h`](https://codebrowser.dev/linux/linux/include/trace/events/syscalls.h.html#18) using the `TRACE_EVENT_SYSCALL` macro.

:summary: More information on TRACE_EVENT_SYSCALL macro
---

Actually, `TRACE_EVENT` is the generic macro for defining custom tracepoints in the kernel, while `TRACE_EVENT_SYSCALL` is a specialized variant for syscalls. 

Instead of writing out each syscall tracepoint manually, it uses the kernel‚Äôs syscall definitions (from the syscall tables) to automatically create matching `sys_enter_<name>` and `sys_exit_<name>` tracepoints, such as `sys_enter_execve`.
::

You can find all events that eBPF tracepoints can hook onto, using:

```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events
```
```
drm:drm_vblank_event
drm:drm_vblank_event_queued
drm:drm_vblank_event_delivered
...
syscalls:sys_exit_execveat
syscalls:sys_enter_execveat
syscalls:sys_exit_execve
syscalls:sys_enter_execve # <- here is our tracepoint
syscalls:sys_exit_pipe
...
```

The output format is in the form `<category>:<name>`.

Using the `category` and the `name`, you can then view the input arguments for a tracepoint by checking the contents of `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/<category>/<name>/format`.

```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_enter_execve/format
```
```
name: sys_enter_execve
ID: 660
format:
        field:unsigned short common_type;           offset:0; size:2; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_flags;           offset:2; size:1; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;   offset:3; size:1; signed:0;
        field:int           common_pid;             offset:4; size:4; signed:1;

        field:int        __syscall_nr;              offset:8;  size:4; signed:1;
        field:const char * filename;                offset:16; size:8; signed:0;
        field:const char *const * argv;             offset:24; size:8; signed:0;
        field:const char *const * envp;             offset:32; size:8; signed:0;

print fmt: "filename: 0x%08lx, argv: 0x%08lx, envp: 0x%08lx", ((unsigned long)(REC->filename)), ((unsigned long)(REC->argv)), ((unsigned long)(REC->envp))
```

üí° The first four arguments, are actually not accessible by the eBPF code. This is a choice that dates back to the original inclusion of this code. See explaination in [commit 98b5c2c65c29](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/98b5c2c65c2951772a8fc661f50d675e450e8bce).
::

But other fields can generally be accessed using our eBPF program like showcased at the bottom in the `print fmt` line.

Using that we can write our eBPF Tracepoint program.

```c [trace.c]
...
struct trace_sys_enter_execve {                                             
    short common_type;                                                      
    char common_flags;                                                      
    char common_preempt_count;                                              
    int common_pid;                                                         
                                                                            
    s32 syscall_nr;        // offset=8,  size=4                             
    u32 pad;               // offset=12, size=4 (pad)                       
    const u8 *filename;    // offset=16, size=8                             
    const u8 *const *argv; // offset=24, size=8                             
    const u8 *const *envp; // offset=32, size=8                             
};                                                                          
                                                                            
SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_execve")                                 
int handle_execve_tp_non_core(struct trace_sys_enter_execve *ctx) {         
    char *filename_ptr = (char *)BPF_PROBE_READ(ctx, filename);             
                                                                            
    u8 buf[ARGSIZE];                                                        
    bpf_probe_read_user_str(buf, sizeof(buf), filename_ptr);                
                                                                             
    bpf_printk("Tracepoint triggered for execve syscall with parameter filename: %s\n", buf);
    return 0;                                                               
}

üí° `SEC("tp/xx/yy")` and `SEC("tracepoint/xx/yy")` are equivalent, and you can use either one according to personal preference.
::

But there are two downsides to this:
- First, they only exist where kernel developers have added them. If you need visibility into that is not supported by the listed tracepoints, you either go through the long process of proposing a new tracepoint upstream (and convincing Linus to accept it), or use an alternative technique.
- Second, they‚Äôre not always ideal for high-performance use cases ‚Äî we‚Äôll dig into that shortly.

## eBPF Raw Tracepoint

Raw Tracepoint may seem not much different than the regular Tracepoint. They are both able to attach to events listed in the `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events` file.

But the main difference is that raw tracepoint does not pass the input context to the eBPF program as tracepoints do ‚Äî a.k.a. constructing the appropriate parameter fields. The Raw tracepoint eBPF program accesses the raw arguments of the event using struct `bpf_raw_tracepoint_args`.

Therefore, raw tracepoint usually [performs a little better than tracepoint](https://lwn.net/Articles/750569/).

Another (rather large) difference is that, in the kernel, there‚Äôs actually no static defined tracepoints on single syscalls but only on generic `sys_enter`/`sys_exit`.

::remark-box
---
kind: info
---

üí° `sys_enter` hooks trigger on every syscall event entry, while `sys_exit` hooks trigger on its return, capturing the return value of the syscall.
::

Therefore, if we want to act on specific syscall kernel event, we need to ‚Äúfilter‚Äù by syscall ID inside our Raw Tracepoint eBPF program.

TODO: highlight it in the code

This is different than regular tracepoints that rely on perf events which allows them to directly attach to a specific kernel event like tp/syscalls/sys_enter_execve as showcased above.

::remark-box
---
kind: info
---

üí° Perf events are a kernel feature for monitoring and profiling Linux systems, capturing hardware events (e.g., cache misses), software events (e.g., context switches), and kernel tracepoints.
::

Notice also that we are reading the arguments of the syscall by extracting them from the CPU registers. The [System V ABI](https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/x86-64-ABI/abi.pdf?job=build) specifies which arguments should be present in which CPU registers.

Since we rely on CPU registers, we need to target our binary for specific system architectures. One way to achieve this is to provide a ‚Äî-target flag if you are using clang.

::remark-box

kind: info

üí° For the example above, I intentionally read the register value using &regs‚Üídi, while the rest of the examples will utilize PT_REGS_PARM* macros which should be preffered.
::

## eBPF Kernel Probes (kprobes)

Regular and raw eBPF tracepoints might in fact be sufficient for your use case, but their main limitation is that they are limited to a set of predefined hook points (and perf events) in the kernel, disallowing you to trace arbitrary kernel events.

Kprobes alleviate this by allowing dynamic hooks into any kernel function, including within function body, not just at the start or return.

::remark-box
---
kind: info
---

üí° Some functions marked with the notrace keyword are exceptions, and kprobes cannot hook onto them.
::

Conveniently, you can list all kernel symbols in `/proc/kallsyms`:
```bash
sudo cat /proc/kallsyms
```
```
TODO: output
```

::remark-box
---
kind: info
---

üí° If a function is not in /proc/kallsyms, it's likely because is was inlined at compile time. Also verify they are not blacklisted in /sys/kernel/debug/krpobes/blacklist.
::

TODO: hihglight code

But the issue with kprobes is that you depend on whatever code happens to be in the kernel your system runs and are not assured to be stable across different kernel versions. Functions might exist in certain kernel versions, while not in others, structs can change, rename, or remove a field you are using.

TODO: We'll look at how to avoid such situations in portable eBPF programs tutorial

The same issues apply to kretprobes ‚Äî kernel probes one can attach to the exit of the function.

Additionally, when we attach a kprobe, it‚Äôs similar to inserting a breakpoint in a debugger: the [kernel patches the target instruction with one that triggers a debug exception](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.6/source/kernel/kprobes.c#L1152) (e.g., BRK on ARM64). When this instruction executes, the exception handler calls our probe handler.

And while this mechanism works well, it has a downside.

Each probe hit generates an exception, causing context switches and exception handling. That overhead may be negligible for infrequent probes, but if many probes are attached to ‚Äúhot‚Äù kernel functions, performance can degrade significantly.

Is there some alternative to allow triggering eBPF programs with less overhead?

Yes ‚Äî read along.

## Fprobes (fentry/fexit)

Unlike kprobes, fprobes can only attach to only kernel function entry points using fentry or exit points using fexit, as their attaching mechanism ([eBPF trampoline](https://lwn.net/Articles/804937/)) differs from that of kprobes.

As mentioned above, Kprobes patch an instruction to trigger a debug exception, adding context-switch and exception-handling overhead.

But, fprobes use the ftrace mechanism where the compiler inserts a NOP at each function entry, which can be patched at runtime into a trampoline.

The trampoline sets up arguments, calls the eBPF program directly, then returns to the function. By avoiding exceptions and using direct calls, fprobes attach/detach faster and run with much lower overhead.

Fprobes programs can also be attached to BPF programs such as XDP, TC or cGroup programs which makes debugging eBPF programs easier. Kprobes lack this capability.

Another advantage is that fexit hook has access to the input parameters to the function, which kretprobe does not.

They do however require at least kernel version 5.5 which might be an issue if you need to support older kernels, at least for now. But otherwise they are mostly superior to kprobes.

üí° Kernel version 5.7 introduces another fprobe program type, named Fmodify_return which run after the fentry program but before the function we are tracing. They allow to override the return value of the kernel function.
