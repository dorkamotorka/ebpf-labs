In this challenge, youâ€™ll tackle the most fundamental eBPF tasks. Weâ€™ve taught you the basics â€” now itâ€™s your turn to put them into practice.

Before you get going, build and run the eBPF application. Youâ€™ll find it in the `ebpf-hello-world/challenge` directory â€” and yes, weâ€™ve slipped in a verifier error on purpose just to keep you on your toes. Your mission - figure out why it fails and fix it.

Itâ€™s an easy one â€” try building and running the "broken" program and youâ€™ll understand.
::

Now that your program is running, letâ€™s inspect it.

Keep it running, then open a second `Term 2` terminal on the right (click the `+` at the top).

Every eBPF program gets a unique ID for tracking. Can you find the ID of the program you just started?

`sudo bpftool --help` is your friend ðŸ˜‰

Sometimes, knowing which user loaded an eBPF program is useful for accountability and security.

Let's find the User Identifier (UID) that loaded the eBPF program of type `tracepoint` with name `challenge`.

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_user_id
:validateRegex: ^[0-9]+$

#active
Waiting for the UID to be identified...

#completed
Well, that wasnâ€™t too tricky â€” it was you! The `challenge` program is the very one you built and ran. But since you used `sudo`, it was technically loaded by `root`. But weâ€™ll let you take the credit this time. ðŸ˜‰
::

We also learned that not all eBPF programs support every eBPF helper function. Can you find whether an eBPF program of type `tracepoint` support the `bpf_override_return()` helper? (Answer with `yes` or `no`)

::remark-box

kind: info

ðŸ’¡ `bpf_override_return()` lets an eBPF program forcibly change the return value of a probed kernel function.

This one is up to you â€” either the eBPF documentation or `sudo bpftool --help` will point you in the right direction ðŸ˜‰
::

What about eBPF maps - can you find the ID of the `exec_count` eBPF map that was defined and loaded in your eBPF program?

Can you recall what eBPF map flag should one provide to the `bpf_map_update_elem()` that adds the entry only if the key doesn't exist yet.

Feel free to check the eBPF docs â€” you donâ€™t need to know everything by heart, just how to find it ðŸ˜‰
