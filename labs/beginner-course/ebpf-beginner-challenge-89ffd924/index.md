In this challenge, you will need to perform the most fundamental eBPF related operation - start a program.

You need to run the program that was build during the eBPF tutorials for beginners, because to complete this challenge you will also need to inspect the running program and answer a few questions about it.
It can be found under `ebpf-hello-world/solution` directory.

Yay! The eBPF program is running ðŸŽ‰

It's an easy one - generate the Go source file (`hello_bpf.go`) that embeds the eBPF object, build the final eBPF application binary and run it.
::


Now, when you have a running program, let's try to understand what it actually is.

To keep track of eBPF program, each one is assigned a unique ID. Can you find the ID of the program that you've just started?

::user-input-task

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_program_id
:validateRegex: ^[a-f0-9]+$
:destination: /tmp/program-id.txt

#active
Waiting for the program ID to be identified...

#completed
Yay! You've found the running program ID ðŸŽ‰

`sudo bpftool --help` is your friend ðŸ˜‰

Can you find the ID of the map that was defined in the program and loaded?
